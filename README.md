# liri-node-app
The language interpretation and recognition interface (LIRI) runs from the terminal so a browser isn't needed. Using one of four commands it can pull up recent tweets and search for a user-inputed song on Spotify or a movie on OMDB. 

## Instructions

1. Open up the terminal. 
2. Navigate to the liri folder.  
3. Type in "node liri.js" followed by one of these commands:
    * my-tweets
    * spotify-this-song "song name here"
    * movie-this "movie title here"
    * do-what-it-says 
4. Be amazed by the power of the node.
